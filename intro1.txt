15th of March, 1984. The Ten-Nation Committee on
Disarmament convenes once again in Paris, and
attempt to push the Doomsday Clock back a couple of
minutes by negotiating an extension of "the long peace".
But a treasonous plot intends to achieve the opposite.

We do not yet know how this will transpire but that´s
where you come in, embedded to work on the internal
switchboard of the hotel where the summit is taking
place. Your goal is to eavesdrop on phone conversations,
gather the intel and forward this to HQ at the end of
each day. Make sure the calls get connected and note
down any information that might be relevant. Fail to
connect three calls, and your cover will be blown.

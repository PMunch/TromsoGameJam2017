“Except the war wasn’t that long ago. It’s just that
people are good at forgetting, but fortunately -
for you, for me - equally good at hoping. And here you
are sitting today, listening to the conversations that
will determine whether the sun will rise again, or fade
behind the fallout till the end of our days.”

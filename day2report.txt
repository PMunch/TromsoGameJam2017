
1. (C) Following up on yesterday’s report, as well as 
new observations, we hereby submit the pertinent 
updates:

1.a) It has come to light that the delegates from 
Hungary and Germany are not on the best of terms. The
Hungarian delegate has indeed succeeded in

################################
+blackmailing the German delegate
extracting valuable intel
securing campaign funds

.

1.b) It is clear that not all delegates trust one 
another. Particularly, Svetlana Aksakova is suspicious 
of
#############
+Ruben Schulz
Laura Clarke
Paul Greening

; and Neil Moore is suspicious of

##############
+Laura Clarke
Paul Greening
Juhani Sarpola

. The former is evidently one of the
interactions that has taken a more significant amount of
air time. It might be worth looking into.

1.c) We are unsure about this final point’s relevance
in any potential threat, but it seemed noteworthy given 
the caller’s contrived manner: the delegate Paul Greene
seems to have taken a rather abrupt interest in

#################
+Svetlana Aksakova
Neil Moore
Luca Moretti

.

2. (C) As is our duty, we shall continue to carry out 
field observations and report accordingly for the 
prosperity of motherland and people. Any further 
guidelines will be incorporated into our routines
without delay upon receival.


1. (C) Following the instructions received regarding the 
undercover surveillance mission, we have the following 
observations to report:

1.a) We have confirmed the identity of the lady in red, 
as per requested by the Colonel General, but her role in 
the matters is not yet clear. Our sources conclude that 
the individual in question is
#############
+Laura Clarke
Zsofi Fekete
Erna Jensberg

. The logical
conclusion to be drawn from the conversations is that
she will be the target of an attempted assassination, but
this is veering on speculation. Nothing else of note can
be asserted for the time being.

1.b) Regarding the report given to our spy on the ground, 
the following information was passed on:

#######################################
+Two birds will be killed with one stone
Cesar will fall
We will cross the Rubicon



1.c) Lastly, two delegates were recorded discussing 
matters of
##############################
+making an impact on the summit
fetishistic affairs
satellite espionage

, respectively
from the
########
+American
+German
Finnish

and
########
+German
+American
Italian

delegations. Details will
follow after a thorough discourse analysis of their
speech.

2. (C) We shall continue to carry out field observations
 and report accordingly for the prosperity of motherland
 and people. Any further guidelines will be incorporated
 into our routines without delay upon receival.

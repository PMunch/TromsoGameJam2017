“Good job officer. You might not receive the praise you
deserve in public, but your efforts have not gone
unnoticed. We dare not think how High Command could have
retaliated, had Paul Greening succeeded in assassinating
our very own delegate. Either way, we will not let this
become another U-2 incident like back in 1960. The cold
war must come to an end, and with some luck, History
will be gracious to you.”
